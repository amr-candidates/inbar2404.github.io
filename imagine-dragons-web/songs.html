                <h3>On Top Of The World</h3>
                <p>On 13 November 2013 the band released an official music video for the song.
                   The video satirizes a popular conspiracy theory that the 1969 Moon landings were faked, the footage having been directed by Stanley Kubrick, and that Kubrick then made references to the fakery in various of his subsequent films.
                   In the video, a rock band similar to the Beatles (played by the members of Imagine Dragons) pretend to be astronauts for the faked moon landing.</p>
